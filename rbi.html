							<h5> Regulatory Challenges & Concerns</h5>
							Every economic activity requires a cash flow in the market for its functioning. For this, the money comes from financial institutions such as banks and non-banking financial institutions. While both types of financial institutions are imperative in accelerating economic growth, this essay is focused on non-banking finance in India. More specifically, non-banking financial institutions have played a major role in strengthening the economy and have been able to carve out a place for themselves in meeting the credit requirements of both wholesale and retail customers. Even though non-banking financial institutions don’t have a full banking license, they perform a diverse set of functions and offer various services such as personal loans, housing loans, insurance, and corporate and institutional services, among many others. <br>
							<br> Among non-banking financial institutions, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs)1 play a central role. According to an Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report, NBFCs represented 75% of the total NBFI assets in India in 2018. They form an integral part of the Indian financial system by providing funding for various important economic activities, thereby contributing to the growth of the Indian economy. Thus, NBFCs provide healthy competition for banks. While banks avail of short-term funds for trade and commerce, NBFCs cater to medium- and long-term credit needs. NBFCs are often borrowing funds from banks and extending them as loans to their customers. NBFCs contribute largely to the economy by lending to infrastructure projects, which are very important to a developing country like India. In the last decade, NBFCs have contributed more to infrastructure lending than banks. They play a complementary role in the financial inclusion agenda of the government and also bring in the much-needed diversity to the financial sector. They help in diversifying the risks, increasing the liquidity in the markets and promoting financial stability. The NBFCs have the edge over banks in providing finance owing to their simplified sanction procedures, flexibility and timeliness in meeting credit needs, and low cost of operations.<br>
							<br>NBFC is further decomposed into NBFC-ND (Non-deposit) and NBFC-D (Deposit), with the latter accepting public deposits as one of the sources of fundraising. NBFC-ND is further divided based on their assets, with NBFC-ND having an asset of ₹5 billion or above considered as NBFC-ND-SI (systemically important). The assets of NBFCs have increased by almost three times from ₹8.7 trillion in 2008-09 to ₹22.7 trillion in 2017-18 (see Table 1). Out of the total assets of NBFCs, the assets of NBFC-ND-SI revolved around 85% throughout the last decade, exhibiting a meagre role of NBFC-D.<br>
							<center><img src="assets/images/table.png" alt="Data Table" height="50%"></center>
							<br>In terms of net owned funds, NBFC-D increased from ₹120 billion in 2008-09 to ₹412 billion in 2017-18. During the same time, NBFC-ND-SI experienced an unprecedented increase in their net owned funds, from ₹1221 billion in 2008-09 to ₹4458 billion in 2017-18 (Figure 1). Thus, NBFC-ND-SI demonstrating a rapid improvement in their financial strength over the last decade.<br>
							<br>Similarly, the government-owned NBFCs constituted around 35.5% share of ND-SI’s assets whereas the figure drops to 12.5% in the case of NBFC-D, showing the dominance of private players in the segment. On the borrowing side, the NBFCs’ borrowing from banks has increased more than threefold between 2008 and 2018, showing the interdependence of the two financial institutions.<br>

							<br>The NBFCs have grown at a very rapid pace in India in the last decade on the backdrop of tremendous GDP growth and high demand for credit for infrastructure, housing and automobiles. However, the current economic downturn and a decline in domestic demand in core sectors have exposed a lot of structural issues in the sector. Next, we discuss the major regulatory challenges and concerns faced in non-banking finance in India.<br>
							<h5>Concerns & Regulations</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<u>Liquidity Crunch</u>: The NBFCs have faced a severe liquidity crisis in recent years. The negative investors’ sentiments have forced many investors to move to other safer assets, the most prominent being the mutual funds industry. The deployment of funds by mutual funds in the NBFC sector has turned negative and stood at -12% in April 2019 as they stopped refinancing their debt. Other investors also followed suit, and the share of NBFC in net credit flow to the commercial sector dropped from over 65% to less than 50%, adversely affecting the balance sheets. 
								</li>
								<li>
									<u>Future Credit by NBFC</u>: NBFC has been a major source for funding infrastructure investment requirements in India. NBFCs provided more than 25% of all infrastructure loans, second only to domestic banks during the period 2012-17. NBFCs being a significant entity in funding the infrastructure projects, the total credit from NBFC dropped by a massive 31%, to ₹1960 billion in March 2019 as compared to ₹2830 billion a year ago. The falling credit by NBFC is a major concern for India as it will require a large amount of money to finance its developmental projects and drive the growth engine.
								</li>
								<li>
									<u>Regulations</u>: Excess bureaucracy has always been a roadblock for the NBFC sector. Since the recent crisis, the regulations on the sector have increased drastically, thereby hampering the capability of NBFC to serve those sections that banks are unable to serve. Concomitantly, fewer regulations might also trigger a crisis again in the future. Thus, ensuring an appropriate level of regulation, which does not hinder the development but also lead to vulnerabilities, is a concern.
								</li>
								<li>
									<u>Unregistered and Unregulated Entities</u>:  A very large number of unregistered and unregulated NBFCs pose a serious risk to the financial sector as their activities cater to the low-income section of society. So, if a crisis like situation occurs in these unregulated NBFCs, then this will directly affect the most vulnerable sections of the society, creating a huge economic and political effect.
								</li>
								    <li>
								    	<u>Trust in NBFCs</u>: In recent years, trust in the non-banking finance sector has declined drastically. The recent defaults by NBFCs have considerably affected lenders’ willingness to lend, such as in the case of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL). Instances of malpractices by various stakeholders in the sector have also shaken the confidence of both the public and corporate world, impacting the NBFC sector in a significant way.</li>
    <li>
    	<u>Contagion Risk</u>: NBFCs are highly integrated with the banking sector and other segments of the financial system. This high level of interlinkages can lead to contagion risk in times of loss of confidence and uncertainty. Thus, even a small disruption can cause a nationwide domino effect similar to what is experienced in the Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) crisis.</li>
							</ul>
							Now, we look at some of the regulatory challenges faced by non-banking finance in India:<br>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<u>Improper Auditing</u>: From the recent cases of inefficient auditing of NBFCs like in the case of IL&FS by one of the most reputed auditors, Deloitte, unfolded the risk of improper auditing. Unethical practices from auditors pose a serious concern on the overall stability of the system. Auditors for a financial statement are analogous to Rating Agencies for security. The recent 2008 global financial crisis gives us a classic example of how the failure of information verifiers can disrupt and adversely affect the whole industry in a shorter run.
								</li>
								<li>
									<u>Regulatory Arbitrage</u>: The regulation of NBFCs has always been different than that of the banks. One advantage of these difference in regulations is that it creates a perfect balance of substitution and complement between the two different categories of lenders. However, an increase in regulation for NBFCs increases the risk of convergence between them and banks and thus can reduce the diversity of lending in the economy. While banks are more regulated, they are given benefits like deposit security and liquidity. On the other hand, NBFCs are generally meant for higher returns with slightly higher risks thus giving investors a variety of assets for investment.
								</li>
								<li>
									<u>Corporate Governance</u>: The governance of NBFCs play a crucial role in the banking sector. The current regulations are insufficient to address the issue of improper lending by its stakeholders for their personal benefits. Regulations regarding the creation of very high leverage are missing which was one of the causes of the 2008 global financial crisis.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h5>Recommedations:</h5>
							Based on the concerns and regulatory challenges, we present our recommendations for ameliorating them. These are:
							<br>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>
									First, non-banking finance in India is struggling not only because of liquidity crunch but also because of the money market’s confidence in most NBFCs’ balance sheets and the credit rating agencies’ ratings. An assessment along the lines of an asset quality review of the major NBFCs will provide a clearer picture and help restore the market’s confidence in non-banking finance.
								</li>
								<li>
									Second, the importance of NBFCs in contributing to lending in the private sector is well recognized. Thus, the RBI can consider facilitating a system in which banks can lend to NBFCs, wherein the latter lends to the priority sector. In that case, the linkages in the transmission process of lending can become more effective.
								</li>
								<li>
									Third, in addition to facilitating a better lending system, RBI has also provided direct lending in the past for institutions like EXIM bank. This has worked well for the export promotion and finance. Similarly, if RBI further lends to select NBFCs, then the NBFCs’ ability to lend can be substantially improved without worrying about risks associated with liquidity.
								</li>
								<li>
									In another way, RBI can make use of risk-weighted Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) requirements. The classification into different categories based on the credibility of the borrower will reduce the default risk. For instance, based on some fundamental parameters, the NBFCs performing best on those parameters can be subjected to lower CRAR, and vice-versa.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h5>Conclusion</h5>
							Overall, non-banking finance has complemented the role of banks without compromising the safety aspects of lending. Most prudential ratios of NBFCs are within the acceptable limits and hence are safe. The essential interlinkages between banks and NBFCs can’t be ignored since contagion risk is always involved. However, the same degree of regulation cannot be applied to banks and NBFCs alike. For instance, the East Asian Crisis of 1997-98 supports the argument that NBFCs cannot be regulated like banks.<br>
							<br>
Further, very strict or inappropriate regulations may hinder economic growth due to a lack of financial innovation and development. The worst-hit will be the infrastructure sector and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), both of which are major contributors to economic growth. While there is no one easy way out of the current NBFC predicament, striking the right balance will be a challenge for financial regulators as regressive policy impetus will be ill-advised for a growing emerging market economy like India.<br>
